# The Go + Protobuf + BufStream Workshop

The goal of this workshop is to get people up to speed on all three of these things as quickly as possible. No assumption is made of knowledge here, so it's likely you will find some overlap with what you know.

You'll also find errors, and this is on purpose.

## Learning By Failure

This lab was generated by Claude Code, with the specific instruction that it "teach through failure". To that end, some chaos was thrown into the examples and it's up to you to find and fix. This will give you a deeper understanding as you go along. And yes, you're encouraged to use AI to help problem solve.

## Track What You've Learned

The workshop is divided into sessions, which should be done in a day. Please don't do more than one session - it pays to move at a slow pace here so you have time to reflect on concepts learned, and journal your progress.

To that end: when you fix an error, log it in your final code. You can do this via comments in your code, or in a `JOURNAL.md` file. Or both. This will help you retain things much better.

In addition: _it's OK to copy/paste from the example code_, however writing Go and Protobuf by hand will get your fingers used to it, which helps your brain map the language structure better. That said, you will likely find yourself writing things _anyway_ as you try to correct problems.

## What's 'Chinook'?

This is a sample database that's just big enough to provide a reasonable set of data to work with, while not filling up your hard drive.
