# Day 6:  Cloud Day - S3 Integration & Deployment

Deploy your pipeline to the cloud! Today you'll integrate with S3, containerize your services, deploy to Kubernetes, and add production observability.

## 🎯 Today's Mission
- Integrate with AWS S3 for data storage
- Containerize services with Docker
- Deploy to Kubernetes with Helm
- Build comprehensive observability

##  Cloud-Native Architecture

### Data Flow
```
PostgreSQL ⚡ Go Service ⚡ Bufstream ⚡ S3
     ⚡           ⚡          ⚡       ⚡
  Metrics    Traces     Events   Analytics
```

### S3 Integration Patterns
- Partitioned data storage by date/hour
- Parquet format for analytics
- Lifecycle policies for cost optimization
- Multi-part uploads for large files

### Container Optimization
- Multi-stage builds for small images
- Security scanning and hardening
- Health checks and graceful shutdown
- Resource limits and requests
