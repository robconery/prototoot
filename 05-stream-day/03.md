# Lab 4: ¡ Stream Processing & Monitoring

Build real-time stream processing capabilities! Implement windowing, aggregation, and comprehensive monitoring.

## <¯ Objectives
- Create real-time data aggregation
- Implement windowing and event correlation  
- Build comprehensive stream monitoring
- Handle backpressure and flow control

## <
 Stream Processing Patterns

### Real-Time Aggregation
- Count events per time window
- Calculate running averages
- Track business metrics in real-time

### Windowing Strategies  
- Tumbling windows for batch processing
- Sliding windows for smooth metrics
- Session windows for user behavior

### Monitoring & Alerting
- Stream health dashboards
- Lag monitoring and alerting
- Error rate tracking

##  Victory Conditions

- [ ] Real-time aggregation produces accurate metrics
- [ ] Windowing handles time-based processing correctly
- [ ] Monitoring provides visibility into stream health
- [ ] Backpressure handling prevents system overload
