# Lab 3: <¯ Message Serialization & Performance

Optimize your streaming pipeline for maximum performance! Master protobuf serialization, compression, and batching strategies.

## <¯ Objectives
- Optimize protobuf message serialization
- Implement compression and batching strategies  
- Build schema registry integration
- Measure and improve streaming performance

## =Ê Performance Optimization Techniques

This lab focuses on real-world performance optimization:

### Message Size Optimization
- Field ordering for efficient encoding
- Choosing optimal data types
- Avoiding unnecessary nested structures

### Compression Strategies
- GZIP for maximum compression
- Snappy for speed-optimized compression  
- LZ4 for balanced performance

### Batching Patterns
- Collect multiple messages before transmission
- Balance between latency and throughput
- Handle partial batch failures

### Schema Registry Integration
- Centralized schema version management
- Compatibility checking automation
- Schema evolution tracking

## =€ Implementation Approach

Build upon Lab 1's streaming foundation by adding:
- Performance measurement tools
- Compression middleware
- Batching collectors
- Schema registry client

##  Victory Conditions

- [ ] Message serialization optimized for size and speed
- [ ] Compression reduces bandwidth usage by >50%
- [ ] Batching improves throughput without latency penalties
- [ ] Schema registry manages versions automatically
